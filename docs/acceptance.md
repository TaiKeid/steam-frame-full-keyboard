# Acceptance checks

Use this checklist for a release candidate. Automated core tests and earlier headset checks do not complete every application combination. Fill the matrix for the specific artifact under review; do not infer untested results from the intended use case. Keep private device logs and machine-specific deployment notes outside the public repository.

## Visuals

- Full-size US arrangement, left Copy/Paste, separated navigation and numpad.
- Flat dark grey surface, white legends, rounded grey gradient keycaps.
- Shallow sides; fixed-size caps translate down on press without stretching or exposing a top side.
- Hover, press and modifier state remain distinguishable at actual headset size.
- Displayed legends and pointer hit regions align across supported scaling.

## Input matrix

Run against harmless test content, first in a dedicated receiver, then in Brave. Open the bundled [input check page](input-check.html) in each Brave mode. Its checklist exercises native controls and focus without logging typed characters or reading the clipboard.

Version 0.5.0: automated ARM64 engine tests cover Korean spaces/digits/punctuation and Chinese punctuation/digits, including failed commits. Missing-module/dependency recovery is tested separately. These automated checks do not substitute for the manual application rows below.

On-device report, 2026-09-29, version 0.5.0: the tester completed all six steps of the bundled input check page using the controllers in both KDE Brave and standalone floating Brave. The passes below are user-reported headset results, not inferred from automation.

| Check | KDE Brave | Standalone floating Brave |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main Enter and numpad Enter deliver key-down/up | Passed | Passed |
| Tab and Shift+Tab change focus correctly | Passed | Passed |
| Ctrl+A, Copy, Paste | Passed | Passed |
| Ctrl/Alt combined with letters on the same backend | Passed | Passed |
| Arrow/navigation/numpad keys | Passed | Passed |
| Focus survives a keyboard pointer click | Passed | Passed |
| No doubled characters from stock keyboard | Passed | Passed |
| Switching apps releases modifiers | Passed | Passed |

The same tester also confirmed typing, Backspace, arrow navigation and Enter in Steam search and KDE Konsole on 0.5.0. These are basic application checks, not a full language-quality or long-session test.

Test a form that submits on Enter and a multiline field that inserts a newline. The keyboard must emit Enter consistently; it cannot force arbitrary websites to implement form submission.

## Configuration, languages and VR switching

- Add a differently sized layout and a custom theme through user JSON files. Reload and select both in VR without rebuilding or restarting.
- Switch layout, language and theme independently, and apply a favorite combination in one step.
- Theme changes affect colors, gradients, geometry of keycaps and state styles while hit regions remain aligned. The approved default remains unchanged.
- Save selection across app restart and an application update; preserve user profile files.
- Reject malformed JSON, duplicate IDs, unsupported schema versions and incompatible language/layout/backend combinations. Keep the last working selection and display a useful error in VR.
- Switch while a modifier is latched or a key is repeating. Release the old mapping and deliver no unintended character to the app.
- Verify English and German output in both Brave modes, including Y/Z, umlauts, Shift, AltGr and shortcuts. Legends must match actual input.
- Check non-Latin font fallback and shaping in the renderer separately from actual language input support.
- Test dead keys, Compose, right-to-left text and IME composition for every profile that advertises them. Unsupported methods must be identified before activation.
- Reload edited profiles and simulate an unwritable settings directory. Preserve the usable runtime state and report failed persistence.

## Lifecycle and recovery

- Full Keyboard launches independently; the existing system keyboard button still opens the stock keyboard.
- Main-view minus/plus icons change width by 5 cm without moving the panel; grabbing handles position and rotation.
- Launching repeatedly retains one owner, restores visibility and recenters it. Closing and reopening creates a fresh owner; abrupt exit leaves no permanent launch lock.
- Recenter clears position/angle offsets while preserving width, including after a tracking-space change.
- Tracking loss and the 30-second grab timeout restore typing.
- Grabbing with either hand disables horizon correction until release.
- Two controllers holding Caps Lock or Num Lock produce one toggle and one backend down/up pair.
- Closing the dashboard hides Full Keyboard and stops local typing without claiming streamed-app controls.
- Cancelled pointer presses, tracking loss, focus loss and close release keys.
- A crash leaves the stock keyboard usable and does not retain a stale instance lock.
- Input connection loss, runtime restart, sleep/wake, and reboot fail or recover predictably.
- Install/update/rollback/uninstall follow the documented steps and preserve user profiles.
- Unsupported runtime interfaces fail without changing Steam files or global input settings.

## Performance and privacy

Measure idle CPU, process memory, redraw time and pointer-to-feedback latency on Frame before setting budgets. Confirm no idle full-frame repaint loop and no texture-replacement flicker.

Typed text and clipboard contents must not appear in logs. Recovery must not paste or replay queued characters into a newly focused application.
